# Spotify Clone Project

Welcome to the Spotify Clone! This project aims to replicate a simple version of Spotify's music player using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can play, pause, and skip through songs in a playlist, view album artwork, and interact with a fully responsive music player. This project also allows for playlist management and song playback from local directories.

## Overview

This Spotify Clone is a dynamic music player that allows users to:

- Browse playlists
- Play, pause, and skip songs
- View song information (title and artist)
- Control the volume
- Navigate between songs with ease

The app fetches songs and playlists from a local server and dynamically updates the UI based on the data retrieved.
